### Report on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for Diabetes Prediction

*** Introduction:
This report documents the process of implementing and evaluating K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers for predicting diabetes based on clinical features. 
The dataset used is "diabetes.csv", containing attributes related to health metrics and patient information.

*** Dataset Overview:
 ***Attributes:**
- The dataset includes various health metrics and patient information:
    - `Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `Insulin`, `BMI`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`, `Age`, and `Outcome`
      (target variable indicating diabetes diagnosis).

 *** Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Initial exploration involved loading the dataset using Pandas (`pd.read_csv()`), examining the first few rows (`df.head()`), data types and missing values (`df.info()`), and basic statistics (`df.describe()`).
  - The correlation matrix (`corr`) was calculated and visualized using a heatmap (`sns.heatmap()`) to understand relationships between features.

*** Data Preprocessing:

 **Handling Missing Values:
  - Checked for missing values (`df.isnull().sum()`) and found none, ensuring no further imputation was required.

 *** Target Variable Distribution:
  - Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (`Outcome`) using a bar plot to understand class imbalance and its implications for model training.

*** Data Splitting:

 *** Train-Test Split:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`, with a test size of 30% and a random state of 2 for reproducibility.

*** Feature Scaling:

 **Normalization:
  - Applied Min-Max scaling using `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to normalize feature values to a range between 0 and 1. This step ensures that all
    features contribute equally to model training without being biased by their scales.

*** KNN Model Construction and Evaluation:

  **Model 1: KNN with k=9 and Euclidean Distance:
  - Constructed a KNN classifier (`KNeighborsClassifier`) with `n_neighbors=9` and `metric="euclidean"` using the training data (`x_train`, `y_train`).
  - Predicted outcomes on the test set (`x_test`) and evaluated the model's accuracy using `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.

  **Model 2: KNN with k=3 and Default Distance Metric:
  - Implemented another KNN classifier (`KNeighborsClassifier`) with `n_neighbors=3` and default distance metric.
  - Predicted outcomes on the test set and calculated the accuracy score.

*** Model Performance:
  **Accuracy Scores:
  - The accuracy scores for both models (`knn6` and `knn3`) were computed and compared to assess their predictive performance on the test set.

*** Conclusion:
- Both KNN classifiers demonstrated reasonable accuracy in predicting diabetes based on clinical features. The choice of `k` and distance metric affects model
  performance, with `k=3` yielding slightly different results compared to `k=9`.
- Further model tuning, such as optimizing `k`, exploring different distance metrics, or feature selection, could potentially improve model accuracy and robustness.
- Overall, KNN classifiers offer a straightforward approach to binary classification tasks like diabetes prediction, leveraging proximity-based learning to make
  predictions based on similar instances in the training data.
